# spam_detection
This is a spam detection project of machine learning in which different libraries are used to detect the spam e-mails. these days scamming is on the peak. Now we will focus on the way to code the project;

First, import the dataset, analyse it. There will be 2 columns spam/ham and emails. We will lemmatize it first and then tokenize it, following algorithms will be applied to dataset and will train the model for detecting then, we can use GUI to make it so better.
